	.Exe lives inside executable.
	If error begins with lnk linker error, c then compiler error.
	Can remove exe and can change the entry point in config properties.

	Unresolved external symbol always happens when linker can't find what it needs.
	Won't Link files that aren't called.

	Static means for that translation unit.
	Use header files to include basic functions.

	Duplicate symbols when 2 of the same function.
	If you mark as static it will be internal only.
