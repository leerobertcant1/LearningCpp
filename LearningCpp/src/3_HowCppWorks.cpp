/*'main' entry point for the application.
no value returned as a special case.

When compiled turned into machine code.

Solution platform x86 is a 32 bit application.
Right click properties on solution to check it's the one I want to debug for.
They're the rules governed for compilation but generally left alone.

Optimisation turned off for Release mode.
Header files are included so essentially pasted code.

When compiled we get obj files and linked by the linker.
Compile individually by Ctrl + F7(Build, Compile), for errors use the Output.
Live inside the solution file with debug.

Use declaration for functions on other files. It tells the compiler exists.
Linker figures out all this, right click Build to see this.
Unresolved external symbol means when Linker can't find it.
