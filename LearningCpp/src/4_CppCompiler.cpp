/*
	Cpp code just a text file.
	We compile and then link, compiling turns into a obj file.

	Tokenising and parsing occurs after we uses an Abstract Syntax tree.
	Converts all of our code to constant data/ instructions.

	Each cpp file a translation unit.
	A file is the way to feed the compiler with source code, it reads via the extension(eg .cpp).
	You can check by including header files and compiling (edit configuration for this).

	Can change to Assembly Only listening in configuration to see the jumping.

	To optimise, config C++ optimisation, 02 speed.
	Then properties config C++, Code Generation, Basic Runtime Checks Default.

	When logging avoid IoStream if possible by just returning a message.

	Obj files linked into a executable so can be ran.
